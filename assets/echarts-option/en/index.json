The `dataZoom` components that control the same axis will be automatically linked (i.e., all of them will be updated when one of them is updated by user action or API call).\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n**✦ How dataZoom componets operates axes and data ✦**\n\n\n\nGenerally `dataZoom` component zoom or roam coordinate system through data filtering and set the windows of axes internally.\n\nIts behaviours vary according to filtering mode settings ([dataZoom.filterMode](~dataZoom.filterMode)).\n\nPossible values:\n\n+ 'filter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered if one of the relevant dimensions is out of the window.\n\n+ 'weakFilter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered only if all of the relevant dimensions are out of the same side of the window.\n\n+ 'empty': data that outside the window will be **set to NaN**, which will not lead to changes of windows of other axes.\n\n+ 'none': Do not filter data.\n\nHow to set `filterMode` is up to users, depending on the requirments and scenarios. Expirically:\n\n+ If only `xAxis` or only `yAxis` is controlled by `dataZoom`, `filterMode: 'filter'` is typically used, which enable the other axis auto adapte its window to the extent of the filtered data.\n\n+ If both `xAxis` and `yAxis` are operated by `dataZoom`:\n\n+ If `xAxis` and `yAxis` should not effect mutually (e.g. a scatter chart with both axes on the type of `'value'`), they should be set to be `filterMode: 'empty'`.\n\n+ If `xAxis` is the main axis and `yAxis` is the auxiliary axis (or vise versa) (e.g., in a bar chart, when dragging `dataZoomX` to change the window of xAxis, we need the yAxis to adapt to the clipped data, but when dragging `dataZoomY` to change the window of yAxis, we need the xAxis not to be changed), in this case, `xAxis` should be set to be `fiterMode: 'filter'`, while `yAxis` should be set to be `fiterMode: 'empty'`.\n\nIt can be demonstrated by the sample:\n\n```javascript\noption = {\ndataZoom: [\n{\nid: 'dataZoomX',\ntype: 'slider',\nxAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'filter'\n},\n{\nid: 'dataZoomY',\ntype: 'slider',\nyAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'empty'\n}\n],\nxAxis: {type: 'value'},\nyAxis: {type: 'value'},\nseries{\ntype: 'bar',\ndata: [\n// The first column corresponds to xAxis,\n// and the second coloum corresponds to yAxis.\n[12, 24, 36],\n[90, 80, 70],\n[3, 9, 27],\n[1, 11, 111]\n]\n}\n}\n```\n\nIn the sample above, `dataZoomX` is set as `filterMode: 'filter'`. When use drags `dataZoomX` (do not touch `dataZoomY`) and the valueWindow of `xAxis` is changed to `[2, 50]` consequently, `dataZoomX` travel the first column of series.data and filter items that out of the window. The series.data turns out to be:\n\n```javascript\n[\n[12, 24, 36],\n// [90, 80, 70] This item is filtered, as 90 is out of the window.\n[3, 9, 27]\n// [1, 11, 111] This item is filtered, as 1 is out of the window.\n]\n```\n\nBefore filtering, the second column, which corresponds to yAxis, has values `24`, `80`, `9`, `11`. After filtering, only `24` and `9` are left. Then the extent of `yAxis` is adjusted to adapt the two values (if `yAxis.min` and `yAxis.max` are not set).\n\nSo `filterMode: 'filter'` can be used to enable the other axis to auto adapt the filtered data.\n\nThen let's review the sample from the beginning, `dataZoomY` is set as `filterMode: 'empty'`. So if user drags `dataZoomY` (do not touch `dataZoomX`) and its window is changed to `[10, 60]` consequently, `dataZoomY` travels the second column of series.data and set NaN to all of the values that outside the window (NaN cause the graphical elements, i.e., bar elements, do not show, but still hold the place). The series.data turns out to be:\n\n```javascript\n[\n[12, 24, 36],\n[90, NaN, 70], // Set to NaN\n[3, NaN, 27],  // Set to NaN\n[1, 11, 111]\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, the first column (i.e., `12`, `90`, `3`, `1`, which corresponds to `xAxis`), will not be changed at all. So dragging `yAxis` will not change extent of `xAxis`, which is good for requirements like outlier filtering.\n\nSee this example:\n~[600x400](doc-example/bar-dataZoom-filterMode&edit=1&reset=1)\n\n\n\nMoreover, when `min`, `max` of an axis is set (e.g., `yAxis: {min: 0, max: 400}`), this extent of the axis will not be modified by the behaviour of dataZoom of other axis any more.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ How to set window ✦**\n\nYou can set the current window in two forms:\n\n+ percent value: see [dataZoom.start](~dataZoom.start) and [dataZoom.end](~dataZoom.end).\n\n+ absolute value: see [dataZoom.startValue](~dataZoom.startValue) and [dataZoom.endValue](~dataZoom.endValue).\n\nNotice: If use percent value form, and it is in the scenario below, the result of dataZoom depends on the sequence of dataZoom definitions appearing in `option`.\n\n\n```javascript\noption = {\ndataZoom: [\n{\nid: 'dataZoomX',\ntype: 'slider',\nxAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'filter',   // Set as 'filter' so that the modification\n// of window of xAxis willl effect the\n// window of yAxis.\nstart: 30,\nend: 70\n},\n{\nid: 'dataZoomY',\ntype: 'slider',\nyAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'empty',\nstart: 20,\nend: 80\n}\n],\nxAxis: {\ntype: 'value'\n},\nyAxis: {\ntype: 'value'\n// Notice there is no min or max set to\n// restrict the view extent of yAxis.\n},\nseries{\ntype: 'bar',\ndata: [\n// The first column corresponds to xAxis,\n// and the second column corresponds to yAxis.\n[12, 24, 36],\n[90, 80, 70],\n[3, 9, 27],\n[1, 11, 111]\n]\n}\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the exact meaning of `start: 20, end: 80` in `dataZoomY` in the example above?\n\n+ If `yAxis.min` and `yAxis.max` are set:\n\n`start: 20, end: 80` of `dataZoomY` means: from `20%` to `80%` out of `[yAxis.min, yAxis.max]`.\n\nIf one of `yAxis.min` and `yAxis.max` is not set, the corresponding edge of the full extend also follow rule as follows.\n\n+ If `yAxis.min` and `yAxis.max` are not set:\n\n+ If `dataZoomX` is set to be `filterMode: 'empty'`:\n\n`start: 20, end: 80` of `dataZoomY` means: from `20%` to `80%` out of `[dataMinY to dataMaxY]` of series.data (i.e., `[9, 80]` in the example above).\n\n+ If `dataZoomX` is set to `filterMode: 'filter'`:\n\nSince `dataZoomX` is defined before `dataZoomY`, `start: 30, end: 70` of `dataZoomX` means: from `30%` to `70%` out of full series.data, whereas `start: 20, end: 80` of `dataZoomY` means: from `20%` to `80%` out of the series.data having been filtered by `dataZoomX`.\n\nIf you want to change the process sequence, you can just change the sequence of the definitions apearing in `option`.\n\n<br>\n<br>",

This is the default situation, when brush is not set to be global.\n\n**Coordinate brushes**\n\nSelecting is enabled only in the assigned coordinates in this case. Selecting-box will be altered according to scaling and translating of coordinate (see `roam` and `dataZoom`).\n\nIn practice, you may often find coordinate brush to be a more frequently made choice, particularly in `geo` charts.\n\nBy assigning [brush.geoIndex](~brush.geoIndex), or [brush.xAxisIndex](~brush.xAxisIndex), or [brush.yAxisIndex](~brush.yAxisIndex), brush selecting axes can be assigned, whose value can be:\n\n+ `'all'`: for all axes;\n+ `number`: like `0`, for a particular coordinate with that index;\n+ `Array`: like `[0, 4, 2]`, for coordinates with those indexes;\n+ `'none'`, or `null`, or `undefined`: for not assigning.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\noption = {\ngeo: {\n...\n},\nbrush: {\ngeoIndex: 'all', // brush selecting is enabled only in all geo charts above\n...\n}\n};\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\noption = {\ngrid: [\n{...}, // grid 0\n{...}  // grid 1\n],\nxAxis: [\n{gridIndex: 1, ...}, // xAxis 0 for grid 1\n{gridIndex: 0, ...}  // xAxis 1 for grid 0\n],\nyAxis: [\n{gridIndex: 1, ...}, // yAxis 0 for grid 1\n{gridIndex: 0, ...}  // yAxis 1 for grid 0\n],\nbrush: {\nxAxisIndex: [0, 1], // brush selecting is enabled only in coordinates with xAxisIndex as `0` or `1`\n...\n}\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**Control select-box with API**\n\n`dispatchAction` can be used to render select-box programatically. For example:\n\n```javascript\nmyChart.dispatchAction({\ntype: 'brush',\nareas: [\n{\ngeoIndex: 0,\n// Assign select-box type\nbrushType: 'polygon',\n// Assign select-box shape\ncoordRange: [[119.72,34.85],[119.68,34.85],[119.5,34.84],[119.19,34.77]]\n}\n]\n});\n```\nPlease refer to [action.brush](api.html#action.brush) for more information.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**brushLink**\n\n\n\nLinks interaction between selected items in different series.\n\nFollowing is an example of enabling selected effect for `scatter` and `parallel` charts once a scatter chart is selected.\n\n`brushLink` is an array of `seriesIndex`es, which assignes the series that can be interacted. For example, it can be:\n\n+ `[3, 4, 5]` for interacting series with seriesIndex as `3`, `4`, or `5`;\n+ `'all'` for interacting all series;\n+ `'none'`, or `null`, or `undefined` for disabling `brushLink`.\n\n**Attention**\n\n`brushLink` is a mapping of `dataIndex`. So **`data` of every series with `brushLink` should be guaranteed to correspond to the other**.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\noption = {\nbrush: {\nbrushLink: [0, 1]\n},\nseries: [\n{\ntype: 'bar'\ndata: [232,    4434,    545,      654]     // data has 4 items\n},\n{\ntype: 'parallel',\ndata: [[4, 5], [3, 5], [66, 33], [99, 66]] // data also has 4 items, which correspond to the data above\n}\n]\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to [brush.brushLink](~brush.brushLink).\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**throttle / debounce**\n\n\n\nBy default, `brushSelected` is always triggered when selection-box is selected or moved, to tell the outside about the event.\n\nBut efficiency problems may occur when events are triggered too frequently, or the animation result may be affected. So brush components provides [brush.throttleType](~brush.throttleType) and [brush.throttleDelay](~brush.throttleDelay) to solve this problem.\n\nValid `throttleType` values can be:\n+ `'debounce'`: for triggering events only when the action has been stopped (no action after some duration). Time threshold can be assigned with [brush.throttleDelay](~brush.throttleDelay);\n+ `'fixRate'`: for triggering event with a certain frequency. The frequency can be assigned with [brush.throttleDelay](~brush.throttleDelay).\n\n\nIn this [example](scatter-map-brush&edit=1&reset=1), `debounce` is used to make sure the bar chart is updated only when the user has stopped action. In other cases, the animation result may not be so good.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**Visual configurations of selected and unselected items**\n\nRefer to [brush.inBrush](~brush.inBrush) and [brush.outOfBrush](~brush.outOfBrush).\n\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\nHere is the configuration in detail.",

For example:\n\n```javascript\n{\ntype: 'rect',\nshape: {\nx: 10,\ny: 10,\nwidth: 100,\nheight: 200\n}\n},\n{\ntype: 'circle',\nshape: {\ncx: 20,\ncy: 30,\nr: 100\n}\n},\n{\ntype: 'image',\nstyle: {\nimage: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a.png',\nx: 100,\ny: 200,\nwidth: 230,\nheight: 400\n}\n},\n{\ntype: 'text',\nstyle: {\ntext: 'This text',\nx: 100,\ny: 200\n}\n\n}\n```\n\n\n**Transforming and Absolutely Positioning of Graphic Element**\n\nElement can be transformed (translation, rotation, scale). See [position](~graphic.elements.position), [rotation](~graphic.elements.rotation), [scale](~graphic.elements.scale), [origin](~graphic.elements.origin)\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n{\ntype: 'rect', // or any other types.\n\n// Translation, using [0, 0] by default.\nposition: [100, 200],\n\n// Scale, using [1, 1] by default.\nscale: [2, 4],\n\n// Rotation, using 0 by default. Negative value means rotating clockwise.\nrotation: Math.PI / 4,\n\n// Origin point of rotation and scale, using [0, 0] by default.\norigin: [10, 20],\n\nshape: {\n// ...\n}\n}\n```\n\nEach element is transformed in the coordinate system of its parent, namely, transform of a element and its parent can be \"stacked\".\n\nTransformation is performed by this order:\n\n1. Translate [-el.origin[0], -el.origin[1]].\n2. Scale according to el.scale.\n3. Rotate according to el.rotation.\n4. Translate back according to el.origin.\n5. Translate according to el.position.\n\nNamely, scaling and rotating firstly, and then translate. By this mechanism, translation does not affect origin of scale and rotation.\n\n\n\n**Relatively Positioning**\n\nIn real application, size of a container is always not fixed. So mechanism of relative position is required. In `graphic` component, [left](~graphic.elements.left) / [right](~graphic.elements.right) / [top](~graphic.elements.top) / [bottom](~graphic.elements.bottom) / [width](~graphic.elements.width) / [height](~graphic.elements.height) are used to position element relatively.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\n{ // Position the image at the bottom center of its container.\ntype: 'image',\nleft: 'center', // Position at the center horizontally.\nbottom: '10%',  // Position beyond the bottom boundary 10%.\nstyle: {\nimage: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a.png',\nwidth: 45,\nheight: 45\n}\n},\n{ // Position the entire rotated group at the right-bottom corner of its container.\ntype: 'group',\nright: 0,  // Position at the right boundary.\nbottom: 0, // Position at the bottom boundary.\nrotation: Math.PI / 4,\nchildren: [\n{\ntype: 'rect',\nleft: 'center', // Position at horizontal center according to its parent.\ntop: 'middle',  // Position at vertical center according to its parent.\nshape: {\nwidth: 190,\nheight: 90\n},\nstyle: {\nfill: '#fff',\nstroke: '#999',\nlineWidth: 2,\nshadowBlur: 8,\nshadowOffsetX: 3,\nshadowOffsetY: 3,\nshadowColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.3)'\n}\n},\n{\ntype: 'text',\nleft: 'center', // Position at horizontal center according to its parent.\ntop: 'middle',  // Position at vertical center according to its parent.\nstyle: {\nfill: '#777',\ntext: [\n'This is text',\n'This is text',\n'Print some text'\n].join('\\n'),\nfont: '14px Microsoft YaHei'\n}\n}\n]\n}\n```\n\nNote, [bounding](graphic.elements.bounding) can be used to specify whether the entire transformed element (containing children if is group) is confined in its container.",

By convention, the heatmap calendar is horizontal. But if we need bigger cell size in other cases, the total width may be too wide. So [calendar.orient](~calendar.orient) can help in this case.\n\n\n---\n\n**Adapt to container size**\n\nCalendar coordinate system can be configured to adapt to container size, which is useful when page size is not sure. First of all, like other components, those location and size configurations can be specified on canlendar: [left](~calendar.left) [right](~calendar.right) [top](~calendar.top) [bottom](bottom) [width](~calendar.width) [height](~calendar.height), which make calendar possible to modify its size according to container size. Besides, [cellSize](~calendar.cellSize) can be specified to fix the size of each cell of calendar.\n\n\n\n---",
