See the code as following:\n\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels both in target series and visualMap-continuous component itself:\ninRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\nIf you want to define visual channels for target series and visualMap-continuous component separately, you should do as follows:\n\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels only for target series.\ntarget: {\ninRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [60, 200]\n}\n},\n// Define visual channels only for visualMap-continuous component.\ncontroller: {\ninRange: {\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\nOr define as follows:\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels for both target series and visualMap-continuous component.\ninRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [60, 200]\n},\n// Define visual channels only for visualMap-continuous component, which\n// will overlap the properties with the same name in the above common\n// definition. (symbolSize is overlapped by [30, 100] while color\n// keeps the original value)\ncontroller: {\ninRange: {\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ About visual channels ✦**\n\n+ Various visual channels (such as `color`、`symbolSize` and ect.) can be defined in inRange at the same time and all of them will be apopted.\n\n+ Basically visual channels `opacity` is recommended, rather than `colorAlpha`. The former controls the transparency of both graphical element and its attachments (like label), whereas the latter only controls the transparency of graphical element.\n\n+ There are two approaches of visual mapping supported: 'Linear Mapping' and 'Table Mapping'.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ Linear Mapping to visual channel ✦**\n\n`Linear Mapping` means that linear calculation will be performed on each dataValue (value of series.data), mapping them from the domain of `[visaulMap.min, visualMap.max]` to a given range of `[visual value 1, visual value 2]` and obtaining a final value (say visual value) for visual channel rendering.\n\nFor instance, `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` is set to be `[0, 100]`, and there is series.data: `[50, 10, 100]`. We intend to map them to an `opacity` range `[0.4, 1]`, by which the size of value can be demostrated by the transparency of graphical elements. visualMap component will then linear calculate them and get opacity values `[0.7, 0.44, 1]`, cooresponding to each dataValue.\n\nWe can also set the visual range inversely, such as `opacity: [1, 0.4]`, and the final mapping result for the given series.data above will be `[0.7, 0.96, 0.4]`.\n\nNotice: [visualMap.min, visualMap.max] should be set manually and is [0, 100] by default, but not `dataMin` and `dataMax` in series.data.\n\n\nHow to configure visualMap component to do Linear Mapping?\n\n+ When use [visualMap-continuous](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-continuous), or\n\n+ When use [visualMap-piecewise](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise) and [visualMap-piecewise.categories](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise.categories) is not used.\n\n\nAbout the value of visual channel (visual value):\n\n+ Basically `Array` is used to express the range of visual value, e.g., `color: ['#333', '#777']`.\n\n+ Single `number` or single `string` can also be used, which will be converted to an `Array` by visualMap component. e.g.:  `opacity: 0.4` will be converted to `opacity: [0.4, 0.4]`, `color: '#333'` will be converted to `color: ['#333', '#333']`.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbolSize`, `opacity`, `colorAlpha`, `colorLightness`, `colorSaturation`, `colorHue`, the range of visual value is always in the form of: `[visual value of visualMap.min, visual value of visualMap.max]`. For example, `colorLightness: [0.8, 0.2]` means that the dataValue in series.data that equals to `visualMap.min` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.8`, and the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.2`, and other dataValues will be mapped by the linear calculateion based on the domain of `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` and the range of `[0.8, 0.2]`.\n\n+ For visual channel `color`, array is used, like: `['#333', '#78ab23', 'blue']`, which means a color ribbon is formed based on the three color stops, and dataValues will be mapped to the ribbon. Specifically, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'#333'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'blue'`, and other dataValues will be piecewisely interpolated to get the final color.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbol`, array is used, like: `['circle', 'rect', 'diamond']`, where the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'circle'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'diamond'`, and other dataValues will be caculated based on the numerical distance to `visualMax.min` and to `visualMap.max`, and mapped onto one of `'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'diamond'`.\n\n\nAbout the possible value range of visual value:\n\n+ `opacity`、`colorAlpha`、`colorLightness`、`colorSaturation`、`visual value`\n\npossible value range is `[0, 1]`.\n\n+ `colorHue`：\n\npossible value range is `[0, 360]`.\n\n+ `color`：\n\ncolor can use RGB expression, like `'rgb(128, 128, 128)'`, or RGBA expression, like `'rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5)'`, or Hex expression, like '#ccc'.\n\n+ `symbol`：\n\n\n\nIcon types provided by ECharts includes\n`'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'roundRect'`, `'triangle'`, `'diamond'`, `'pin'`, `'arrow'`, `'none'`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be set to an image with `'image://url'` , in which URL is the link to an image, or `dataURI` of an image.\n\n\nAn image URL example:\n\n```\n'image://http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a/b.png'\n```\n\nA `dataURI` example:\n\n```\n'image://data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAORHHOVSKudfOulrSOp3WOyDZu6QdvCchPGolfO0o/XBs/fNwfjZ0frl3/zy7////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAkAABAALAAAAAAQABAAAAVVICSOZGlCQAosJ6mu7fiyZeKqNKToQGDsM8hBADgUXoGAiqhSvp5QAnQKGIgUhwFUYLCVDFCrKUE1lBavAViFIDlTImbKC5Gm2hB0SlBCBMQiB0UjIQA7'\n```\n\n\nIcons can be set to arbitrary vector path via `'path://'` in ECharts. As compared with a raster image, vector paths prevent jagging and blurring when scaled, and have better control over changing colors. The size of the vector icon will be adapted automatically. Refer to [SVG PathData](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) for more information about the format of the path.

And there is series.data: `['Demon Hunter', 'Death Knight', 'Warden', 'Paladin']`. Then we can establish the lookup rule for color: `color: {'Warden': 'red', 'Demon Hunter': 'black'}`, by which the `visualMap` component will map `dataValue` to `color`.\n\nHow to configure `visualMap` component to do `Table Mapping`?\n\nWhen use [visualMap-piecewise](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise) and [visualMap-piecewise.categories](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise.categories)is set.\n\nAbout the value of visual channel (visual value):\n\nGenerally `Object` or `Array` is used, for instance:\n\n```javascript\nvisualMap: {\ntype: 'piecewise',\n// categories defines the items that to be displayed in visualMap-piecewise component.\ncategories: [\n'Demon Hunter', 'Blademaster', 'Death Knight', 'Warden', 'Paladin'\n],\ninRange: {\n// visual value can be an Object：\ncolor: {\n'Warden': 'red',\n'Demon Hunter': 'black',\n'': 'green' // Blank string means that except 'Warden' and 'Demon Hunter',\n// all other dataValues should be mapped to 'green'.\n}\n// visual value can also be a single value,\n// means that all dataValues should be mapped to the value.\ncolor: 'green',\n// visual value can also be a array, with the same length\n// as the array of categories and one-one mapping onto it.\ncolor: ['red', 'black', 'green', 'yellow', 'white']\n}\n}\n```\n\n[Example](doc-example/scatter-visualMap-categories&edit=1&reset=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**✦ How to modity configurations of vsiual encoding? ✦**\n\nIf you want to modify the configurations of visual encoding after chart been rendered (by invoke `setOption` to set the initial `option`), `setOption` can be used again to modify configurations of visual encoding. For instance:\n\n```javascript\nchart.setOption({\nvisualMap: {\ninRange: {color: ['red', 'blue']}\n}\n});\n```\n\nNotice:\n\n+ These visualMap properties (i.e. `inRange`, `outOfRange`, `target`, `controller`) do not support \"merge\", that is, anyone among them is modified when use `setOption` again, all of the original values of them will not be kept but erased. The \"merge\" brings complication in implemnentation and understanding, whereas \"erase all\" normalize the practise: once you want to modify some visual values, you should pass all of them to `setOption`, no matter they are to be changed.\n\n+ This way, `getOption() -> modify the gotten option -> setOption(modified option)`, is strongly **not recommended**, for instance:\n\n```javascript\n// Not recommended approach, regardless of its correctness:\n\nvar option = chart.getOption(); // Get the entire option.\noption.visualMap.inRange.color = ['red', 'blue']; // modify color, which is what you want.\n\n// You have to modify those two properties, otherwise you will not get what you want.\noption.visualMap.target.inRange.color = ['red', 'blue'];\noption.visualMap.controller.inRange.color = ['red', 'blue'];\n\nchart.setOption(option); // set the modified option back.\n// You should not use this approach, but use the\n// approach demostrated before this example.\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Notice:** There is default color `['#f6efa6', '#d88273', '#bf444c']` in `inRange` if you not set `inRange`. If you dont want it, set `inRange: {color: null}` to disable it.",

The former controls the transparency of both graphical element and its attachments (like label), whereas the latter only controls the transparency of graphical element.\n\n+ There are two approaches of visual mapping supported: 'Linear Mapping' and 'Table Mapping'.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ Linear Mapping to visual channel ✦**\n\n`Linear Mapping` means that linear calculation will be performed on each dataValue (value of series.data), mapping them from the domain of `[visaulMap.min, visualMap.max]` to a given range of `[visual value 1, visual value 2]` and obtaining a final value (say visual value) for visual channel rendering.\n\nFor instance, `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` is set to be `[0, 100]`, and there is series.data: `[50, 10, 100]`. We intend to map them to an `opacity` range `[0.4, 1]`, by which the size of value can be demostrated by the transparency of graphical elements. visualMap component will then linear calculate them and get opacity values `[0.7, 0.44, 1]`, cooresponding to each dataValue.\n\nWe can also set the visual range inversely, such as `opacity: [1, 0.4]`, and the final mapping result for the given series.data above will be `[0.7, 0.96, 0.4]`.\n\nNotice: [visualMap.min, visualMap.max] should be set manually and is [0, 100] by default, but not `dataMin` and `dataMax` in series.data.\n\n\nHow to configure visualMap component to do Linear Mapping?\n\n+ When use [visualMap-continuous](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-continuous), or\n\n+ When use [visualMap-piecewise](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise) and [visualMap-piecewise.categories](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise.categories) is not used.\n\n\nAbout the value of visual channel (visual value):\n\n+ Basically `Array` is used to express the range of visual value, e.g., `color: ['#333', '#777']`.\n\n+ Single `number` or single `string` can also be used, which will be converted to an `Array` by visualMap component. e.g.:  `opacity: 0.4` will be converted to `opacity: [0.4, 0.4]`, `color: '#333'` will be converted to `color: ['#333', '#333']`.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbolSize`, `opacity`, `colorAlpha`, `colorLightness`, `colorSaturation`, `colorHue`, the range of visual value is always in the form of: `[visual value of visualMap.min, visual value of visualMap.max]`. For example, `colorLightness: [0.8, 0.2]` means that the dataValue in series.data that equals to `visualMap.min` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.8`, and the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.2`, and other dataValues will be mapped by the linear calculateion based on the domain of `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` and the range of `[0.8, 0.2]`.\n\n+ For visual channel `color`, array is used, like: `['#333', '#78ab23', 'blue']`, which means a color ribbon is formed based on the three color stops, and dataValues will be mapped to the ribbon. Specifically, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'#333'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'blue'`, and other dataValues will be piecewisely interpolated to get the final color.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbol`, array is used, like: `['circle', 'rect', 'diamond']`, where the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'circle'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'diamond'`, and other dataValues will be caculated based on the numerical distance to `visualMax.min` and to `visualMap.max`, and mapped onto one of `'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'diamond'`.\n\n\nAbout the possible value range of visual value:\n\n+ `opacity`、`colorAlpha`、`colorLightness`、`colorSaturation`、`visual value`\n\npossible value range is `[0, 1]`.\n\n+ `colorHue`：\n\npossible value range is `[0, 360]`.\n\n+ `color`：\n\ncolor can use RGB expression, like `'rgb(128, 128, 128)'`, or RGBA expression, like `'rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5)'`, or Hex expression, like '#ccc'.\n\n+ `symbol`：\n\n\n\nIcon types provided by ECharts includes\n`'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'roundRect'`, `'triangle'`, `'diamond'`, `'pin'`, `'arrow'`, `'none'`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be set to an image with `'image://url'` , in which URL is the link to an image, or `dataURI` of an image.\n\n\nAn image URL example:\n\n```\n'image://http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a/b.png'\n```\n\nA `dataURI` example:\n\n```\n'image://data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAORHHOVSKudfOulrSOp3WOyDZu6QdvCchPGolfO0o/XBs/fNwfjZ0frl3/zy7////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAkAABAALAAAAAAQABAAAAVVICSOZGlCQAosJ6mu7fiyZeKqNKToQGDsM8hBADgUXoGAiqhSvp5QAnQKGIgUhwFUYLCVDFCrKUE1lBavAViFIDlTImbKC5Gm2hB0SlBCBMQiB0UjIQA7'\n```\n\n\nIcons can be set to arbitrary vector path via `'path://'` in ECharts.

See the code as following:\n\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels both in target series and visualMap-continuous component itself:\noutOfRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\nIf you want to define visual channels for target series and visualMap-continuous component separately, you should do as follows:\n\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels only for target series.\ntarget: {\noutOfRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [60, 200]\n}\n},\n// Define visual channels only for visualMap-continuous component.\ncontroller: {\noutOfRange: {\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\nOr define as follows:\n```javascript\nvisualMap: [\n{\n...,\n// Define visual channels for both target series and visualMap-continuous component.\noutOfRange: {\ncolor: ['#121122', 'rgba(3,4,5,0.4)', 'red'],\nsymbolSize: [60, 200]\n},\n// Define visual channels only for visualMap-continuous component, which\n// will overlap the properties with the same name in the above common\n// definition. (symbolSize is overlapped by [30, 100] while color\n// keeps the original value)\ncontroller: {\noutOfRange: {\nsymbolSize: [30, 100]\n}\n}\n}\n]\n```\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ About visual channels ✦**\n\n+ Various visual channels (such as `color`、`symbolSize` and ect.) can be defined in outOfRange at the same time and all of them will be apopted.\n\n+ Basically visual channels `opacity` is recommended, rather than `colorAlpha`. The former controls the transparency of both graphical element and its attachments (like label), whereas the latter only controls the transparency of graphical element.\n\n+ There are two approaches of visual mapping supported: 'Linear Mapping' and 'Table Mapping'.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n**✦ Linear Mapping to visual channel ✦**\n\n`Linear Mapping` means that linear calculation will be performed on each dataValue (value of series.data), mapping them from the domain of `[visaulMap.min, visualMap.max]` to a given range of `[visual value 1, visual value 2]` and obtaining a final value (say visual value) for visual channel rendering.\n\nFor instance, `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` is set to be `[0, 100]`, and there is series.data: `[50, 10, 100]`. We intend to map them to an `opacity` range `[0.4, 1]`, by which the size of value can be demostrated by the transparency of graphical elements. visualMap component will then linear calculate them and get opacity values `[0.7, 0.44, 1]`, cooresponding to each dataValue.\n\nWe can also set the visual range inversely, such as `opacity: [1, 0.4]`, and the final mapping result for the given series.data above will be `[0.7, 0.96, 0.4]`.\n\nNotice: [visualMap.min, visualMap.max] should be set manually and is [0, 100] by default, but not `dataMin` and `dataMax` in series.data.\n\n\nHow to configure visualMap component to do Linear Mapping?\n\n+ When use [visualMap-continuous](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-continuous), or\n\n+ When use [visualMap-piecewise](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise) and [visualMap-piecewise.categories](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#visualMap-piecewise.categories) is not used.\n\n\nAbout the value of visual channel (visual value):\n\n+ Basically `Array` is used to express the range of visual value, e.g., `color: ['#333', '#777']`.\n\n+ Single `number` or single `string` can also be used, which will be converted to an `Array` by visualMap component. e.g.:  `opacity: 0.4` will be converted to `opacity: [0.4, 0.4]`, `color: '#333'` will be converted to `color: ['#333', '#333']`.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbolSize`, `opacity`, `colorAlpha`, `colorLightness`, `colorSaturation`, `colorHue`, the range of visual value is always in the form of: `[visual value of visualMap.min, visual value of visualMap.max]`. For example, `colorLightness: [0.8, 0.2]` means that the dataValue in series.data that equals to `visualMap.min` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.8`, and the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` (if any) will be mapped to lightness `0.2`, and other dataValues will be mapped by the linear calculateion based on the domain of `[visualMap.min, visualMap.max]` and the range of `[0.8, 0.2]`.\n\n+ For visual channel `color`, array is used, like: `['#333', '#78ab23', 'blue']`, which means a color ribbon is formed based on the three color stops, and dataValues will be mapped to the ribbon. Specifically, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'#333'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'blue'`, and other dataValues will be piecewisely interpolated to get the final color.\n\n+ For visual channel `symbol`, array is used, like: `['circle', 'rect', 'diamond']`, where the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.min` will be mapped onto `'circle'`, the dataValue that equals to `visualMap.max` will be mapped onto `'diamond'`, and other dataValues will be caculated based on the numerical distance to `visualMax.min` and to `visualMap.max`, and mapped onto one of `'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'diamond'`.\n\n\nAbout the possible value range of visual value:\n\n+ `opacity`、`colorAlpha`、`colorLightness`、`colorSaturation`、`visual value`\n\npossible value range is `[0, 1]`.\n\n+ `colorHue`：\n\npossible value range is `[0, 360]`.\n\n+ `color`：\n\ncolor can use RGB expression, like `'rgb(128, 128, 128)'`, or RGBA expression, like `'rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5)'`, or Hex expression, like '#ccc'.\n\n+ `symbol`：\n\n\n\nIcon types provided by ECharts includes\n`'circle'`, `'rect'`, `'roundRect'`, `'triangle'`, `'diamond'`, `'pin'`, `'arrow'`, `'none'`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be set to an image with `'image://url'` , in which URL is the link to an image, or `dataURI` of an image.\n\n\nAn image URL example:\n\n```\n'image://http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a/b.png'\n```\n\nA `dataURI` example:\n\n```\n'image://data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAORHHOVSKudfOulrSOp3WOyDZu6QdvCchPGolfO0o/XBs/fNwfjZ0frl3/zy7////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAkAABAALAAAAAAQABAAAAVVICSOZGlCQAosJ6mu7fiyZeKqNKToQGDsM8hBADgUXoGAiqhSvp5QAnQKGIgUhwFUYLCVDFCrKUE1lBavAViFIDlTImbKC5Gm2hB0SlBCBMQiB0UjIQA7'\n```\n\n\nIcons can be set to arbitrary vector path via `'path://'` in ECharts. As compared with a raster image, vector paths prevent jagging and blurring when scaled, and have better control over changing colors. The size of the vector icon will be adapted automatically. Refer to [SVG PathData](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) for more information about the format of the path.
